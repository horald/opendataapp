 # How to Use Simple Member

 -- At this time there are no admin utilities to view, edit, remove your members, etc.
 -- The login / add member script is located at http://domain/to/main/path/index.php
 -- Your members area would be located in member.php ... so this is where you
    would put content that you want only your members to see. You may copy
    member.php into a new file to add multiple member restricted pages. Look
    for the MEMBER CONTENT GOES HERE comment.
